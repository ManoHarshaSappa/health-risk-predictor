    "* Uses an XGBoost model to predict heart disease risk\n",
    "* Uses ChatGPT (LLM) to explain predictions in plain English\n",
    "* Provides a Flask-based web interface for user input and output\n",

    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project combines a structured ML model and a natural language AI assistant to deliver medical predictions in an understandable, web-based format. Flask is used for easy routing, rendering, and API handling — giving flexibility to use any LLM API such as OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. System Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. User enters health parameters in a web form\n",
    "2. Flask sends the input to XGBoost model for prediction\n",
    "3. The predicted result and input are formatted into a prompt\n",
    "4. Prompt is sent to ChatGPT using OpenAI API\n",
    "5. ChatGPT returns a human-readable explanation\n",
    "6. Flask displays prediction and explanation on the results page\n",

    "### XGBoost Model\n",
    "\n",
    "* Trained on structured health data\n",
    "* Saved using `pickle` or `joblib` (`.pkl` file)\n",
    "* Predicts binary risk (`0` = no risk, `1` = high risk)\n",
    "\n",
    "### ChatGPT LLM\n",
    "\n",
    "* Accessed via OpenAI API (`gpt-3.5-turbo` or `gpt-4`)\n",
    "* Receives structured input + prediction\n",
    "* Returns a natural language summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### Flask Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "* `/` route: Input form (age, sex, cp, chol, etc.)\n",
    "* `/predict` route: Handles prediction + LLM call\n",
    "* `/result`: Renders output page with both results\n",
